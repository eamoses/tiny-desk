# Tiny Desk

My Tiny Desk Concert search: http://tiny-desk.com/

This is a basic text matching filter I've created from the data on [NPR's Tiny Desk Concert website.](https://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/)

## GAS Stack Integration

I'm using Google Apps Scripts to automate a Twitter bot (@TinyDeskBot) to tweet out a random Tiny Desk Concert every four hours.  

The data is coming from the Node.js program I wrote (not currently public yet) to scrape the NPR Music website for their archive of Tiny Desk concerts.  

I am doing this manually and copy/pasting the large data set over into the `data.gs` file, but I'd like to automate this process in the future.

## My Motivation

They do make available an archive which organizes concerts by year and month, but if you want to search by artist you have to use [NPR's main search](https://www.npr.org/search) which also searches news articles and things unrelated to Tiny Desk.

I hope you like my creation! There's always room for improvements. If you'd like to add a suggestion, my email is e.a.moses@gmail.com
