# Tiny Desk

My Tiny Desk Concert search: http://tiny-desk.com/

This is a basic text matching filter I've created from the data on [NPR's Tiny Desk Concert website.](https://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/)

## My Motivation

They do make available an archive which organizes concerts by year and month, but if you want to search by artist you have to use [NPR's main search](https://www.npr.org/search) which also searches news articles and things unrelated to Tiny Desk.

I hope you like my creation! There's always room for improvements. If you'd like to add a suggestion, my email is e.a.moses@gmail.com

Or, if you'd like to throw me a few üí∏ (dollars) of appreciation, feel free to [buy me a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/emilyannemoses) or [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/eamoses)
